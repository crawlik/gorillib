h3. 2011-08-21 - Version 0.1.6: Serialization and DeepHash

* Serialization with #to_wire -- like #to_hash, but hands #to_wire down the line to any element that contains it (as opposed to `#to_hash`, which should just do that)
* Hashlike#tree_merge: combined into the one version; gave it a block in the middle to do any fancy footwork
* deep_hash -- allows dotted (a.b.c) access to a nested hash
* Array#random_element -- gets a random member of the array.

Will soon be deprecating Receiver, in favor of the far more powerful Icss::ReceiverModel in the icss library.

h3. 2011-06-29 - Version 0.1.3: Fancier receivers

* can now mix activemodel into a receiver, getting all its validation and other awesomeness
* added receiver_model as an experimental 'I'm a fancy cadillac-style receiver'

h3. 2011-06-24 Version 0.1.2: Receiver body fixes

* Better @Object.try@ (via active_support)
* Receiver body can now be an interpolated string or a hash; this lets you use anonymous classes. Added tuple methods (does an in-order traversal).
* Bugfix for inclusion order in ActsAsHash

h3. Version 0.1.0: Hashlike refactor, Receiver arrives

v0.1.0 brings
* Receiver module
* refeactoring of hash decorations into a new hashlike class
* ability to inject hashlike behavior into Struct

h3. Version 0.0.7: full test coverage!
